# appUnblocker
Open almost any executable file without administrator.

# How it works
appUnblocker uses an oversight in `SET __COMPAT_LAYER` in batchscript, then using the `RunAsInvoker` variable, which allows you to run most executable files without administrator.

# Compatibility
appUnblocker is supported on Windows 10/11.
> [!NOTE]
> appUnblocker may work on older Windows releases, but it may not be consistent in its success or is even fully supported.

# Install
